# Razorpay iOS Sample App

This repository demonstrates how to integrate Razorpay's iOS Framework.
The app built from code in this repository can be found on the AppStore.

### To run the example app:
Sign up for a Razorpay Account(https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/access/signin) and generate the API Keys(https://razorpay.com/docs/payment-gateway/dashboard-guide/settings/#api-keys/) from the Razorpay Dashboard

1. If you haven't already, sign up for a [Razorpay account](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/access/signin).
2. Open `.xcodeproj` with Xcode.
3. Fill in the `KEY_ID` constant in `./Razorpay Sample App/RazorpaySampleApp/ViewController.m` with your Razorpay [test "key"](https://razorpay.com/docs/payment-gateway/dashboard-guide/settings/#api-keys/). This key should start with `rzp_test`.

After this is done, you can make test payments through the app and see them in your [Razorpay dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com).
